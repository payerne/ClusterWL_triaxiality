# ClusterWL_triaxiality

This repository provides tools to generate mock shear and convergence maps for elliptical clusters. It provides also the tools to estimate the cluster lensing shear multipoles from sheared background galaxies, as well as modelling the lensing multipoles. 

- These data analysis and modeling codes are used in the context of my work within The Three Hundred cluster simulation project ([Cui et al. 2018](http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.2898C/abstract)). The official website of the poject can be found [here] (https://weiguangcui.github.io/the300/)
